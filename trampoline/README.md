# CheviotOS Trampoline Microkernel

## Work-in-Progress

The trampoline microkernel is a work-in-progress and is currently unused in CheviotOS.
It's intent is to allow CheviotOS to support multiple protection rings by placing
each ring in its own address space using a mechanism similar to Kernel Page Table Isolation.
